# CryptoClustering
Unsupervised Learning Using Cryptocurrency Data

## About the Project
The objective of this project is to predict whether crytocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes
using Python (via Jupyter Notebook) and Unsupervised Learning. 
To begin the project, a starter code file titled, 'Crypto_Clustering_stater_code.ipynb,' was utilized. As a note, 
this starter file was renamed to 'Crypto_Clustering.ipynb,' which can be found in this repository.

## Getting Started (Required Libraries and Dependencies)
- Pandas
- hvPlot
- numpy
- scikit-learn (KMeans, PCA, StandardScaler)

## Data 
The dataset used for this project is included in the 'Resources' folder of this repository and is titled,
'crypto_market_data.csv.' This dataset has been provided by the Penn Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp.
